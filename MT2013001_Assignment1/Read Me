1)The program would have to be started by running the makefile using the compand make.

2)The user can choose the points by the use of the mouse.i.e using the left mouse button.

3)After clicking on the mouse clicks the users would have to choose the algorithm which is supposed to be used 
  the algorithm can be choosed by the either using the 'b' or 'd' for Bernstein polynomial and De CastelJau Algorithm respectively.

4)The actual curve is drawn on the right click of the mouse.

5)The redraw functionality is also present in the program, as soon as new point are added the bezeir curve disappear and whenever the right 
  button of the mouse is clicked again the curve is redrawn.

6)The elementary glrotate, glscale and gltranslate functionality is implemented on the redrawing the curve by corresponding 'r', 's' and 't' 
  button of the keyboard respectively. The glorate, glscale and gltranslate as a factor on the redraw functionality. On each redraw the curve is rotate is rotated
  on the z-axis by a 5 degree with respect to the previous drawn curve, similarly the curve is scale by a factor of 1.1  and translated to a coordinate 
  system where  the x-axis is translated by 1 unit on every redraw with respect to the previous curve's coordinate system.
